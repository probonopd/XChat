XChat 2.0.0pre1 RELEASE NOTES:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* If you used early 1.9 versions (1.9.0/1/2), you might want to delete
  ~/.xchat2/ to get new defaults (backup your servlist_.conf if you made
  major changes).

* By default, xchat will use Pango to render text. This is usually quite
  fast, if you have Pango 1.1 and Xft2 on your system. If you need to use
  Pango 1.0, or find text rendering slow, you can use the ./configure switch
  --enable-xft, which will bypass Pango. NB: --enable-xft will also remove
  some of Pango's nice i18n features, such as multiple fonts and bidi.
  If you use --enable-xft, make sure xchat is built using the same version
  of Xft as pango is. If pango is using Xft1 and xchat Xft2, bad things will
  happen (like holes in space-time etc).

* Having trouble with character sets, umlauts, accented characters etc?
  Refer to: http://xchat.org/encoding.html

* The perl plugin before version 1.9.5 was very buggy and almost always
  crashed. Delete this file if it's still hanging around:
    /usr/lib/xchat/plugins/perl.so
    /usr/local/lib/xchat/plugins/perl.so
  If you build the perl plugin from this archive, perl.so should be
  overwritten and run ok.


Notes for packagers:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* If you need your packages to work on i386, you don't need to compile with
  --disable-mmx, because it's also checked at run-time.
