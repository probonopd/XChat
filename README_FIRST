XChat 2.0.0pre1 RELEASE NOTES:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* If you used early 1.9 versions (1.9.0/1/2), you might want to delete
  ~/.xchat2/ to get new defaults (backup your servlist_.conf if you made
  major changes).

* By default, xchat will use Pango to render text. This is usually quite
  fast, if you have Pango 1.1 and Xft2 on your system. If you need to use
  Pango 1.0, or find text rendering slow, you can use the ./configure switch
  --enable-xft, which will bypass Pango. NB: --enable-xft will also remove
  some of Pango's nice i18n features, such as multiple fonts and bidi.
  If you use --enable-xft, make sure xchat is built using the same version
  of Xft as pango is. If pango is using Xft1 and xchat Xft2, bad things will
  happen (like holes in space-time etc).

* Having trouble with character sets, umlauts, accented characters etc?
  Refer to: http://xchat.org/encoding.html

* The perl plugin before version 1.9.5 was very buggy and almost always
  crashed. Delete this file if it's still hanging around:
    /usr/lib/xchat/plugins/perl.so
    /usr/local/lib/xchat/plugins/perl.so
  If you build the perl plugin from this archive, perl.so should be
  overwritten and run ok.


Notes for packagers:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 If you need your packages to work on i386, you don't need to compile with
 --disable-mmx, because it's also checked at run-time.


BUGS/Crashes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	http://xchat.org/cvs.html


Python Scripts:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Scripts for 1.8.x are not compatible, and a brand new interface has be
 written. Documentation can be found here: http://xchat.org/docs.html.
 Consider using the Python interface for your scripts, it's a very nice
 API, allows for loading/unloading individual scripts, and gives you
 almost all the features of the C-Plugin API.


Perl Scripts:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Scripts for 1.8.x are compatible with the following exceptions:

* user_list and user_list_short:
  If a user has both op and voice, only the op flag will be 1.

* dcc_list
  The address field is always 0.

* add_user_list/sub_user_list/clear_user_list
  These functions do nothing.

* notify_list
  Not implemented. Always returns an empty list.

* server_list
  Lists servers that are not connected aswell.

* Text printed by scripts must now be UTF8.

* Text passed to scripts (via add_message_handler) will be encoded in UTF8.
