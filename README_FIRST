XChat 2.0.1 RELEASE NOTES:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* This is a zero-dot-zero release, it will not be bug free.
  See http://xchat.org/cvs.html#bugs for a list of outstanding bugs.

* If you used early 1.9 versions (1.9.0/1/2), you might want to delete
  ~/.xchat2/ to get new defaults (backup your servlist_.conf if you made
  major changes).

* By default, xchat will use Pango to render text. This is usually quite
  fast, if you have Pango 1.1 and Xft2 on your system. If you need to use
  Pango 1.0, or find text rendering slow, you can use the ./configure switch
  --enable-xft, which will bypass Pango. NB: --enable-xft will also remove
  some of Pango's nice i18n features, such as multiple fonts and bidi.
  If the text is still unbearably slow, disable font smoothing in Gnome2
  Font Preferences.

* Having trouble with character sets, umlauts, accented characters etc?
  Refer to: http://xchat.org/encoding.html


Notes for packagers:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 If you need your packages to work on i386, you don't need to compile with
 --disable-mmx, because it's also checked at run-time.

Python Scripts:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Scripts for 1.8.x are not compatible, and a brand new interface has be
 written. Documentation can be found here: http://xchat.org/docs.html.
 Consider using the Python interface for your scripts, it's a very nice
 API, allows for loading/unloading individual scripts, and gives you
 almost all the features of the C-Plugin API.


Perl Scripts:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Scripts for 1.8.x are compatible with the following exceptions:

* IRC::command will not interpret %C, %B, %U etc.

* user_list and user_list_short:
  If a user has both op and voice, only the op flag will be 1.

* add_user_list/sub_user_list/clear_user_list
  These functions do nothing.

* notify_list
  Not implemented. Always returns an empty list.

* server_list
  Lists servers that are not connected aswell.

* Some print events may have new names and some were added.

* Text printed by scripts must now be UTF8.

* Text passed to scripts (via add_message_handler) will be encoded in UTF8.
