XChat 1.9.7 RELEASE NOTES:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The perl plugin before version 1.9.5 was very buggy and almost always
  crashed. Delete this file if it's still hanging around:
    /usr/lib/xchat/plugins/perl.so
    /usr/local/lib/xchat/plugins/perl.so
  If you build the perl plugin from this archive, perl.so should be
  overwritten and run ok.

* You might want to ./configure --disable-xft
  Disadvantages:
    It's a little slower (with pango 1.1 and Xft2 it's hardly noticeable).
  Advantages:
    Better i18n. Falling back to pango will support multiple fonts
    (i.e. when a particular character is not available in your selected
     font, it'll try to find it in another font).
    Bidi/reverse-text works.

* If you use Xft directly (not --disable-xft), you need to make sure pango
  is compiled with Xft support and GDK_USE_XFT=1.

  /usr/lib$ ldd libpangoxft-1.0.so | grep -i Xft
	libXft.so.2 => /usr/lib/libXft.so.2 (0x4005d000)

* If you used very early 1.9 versions (1.9.0/1/2), you might want to
  delete ~/.xchat2/ to get new defaults (backup your servlist_.conf if
  you made major changes).

* Having trouble with character sets, umlauts, upper ascii etc?
  Refer to: http://xchat.org/encoding.html


Notes for packagers:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* If you need your packages to work on i386, you don't need to compile with
  --disable-mmx, because it's also checked at run-time.

* If you don't use --disable-xft, make sure xchat is built using the same
  version of Xft as pango! If pango is using Xft1 and xchat Xft2, bad things
  will happen (like holes in space-time etc).
